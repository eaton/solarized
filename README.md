Solarized for Colloquy
========================

Colors matter, and [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)
 is the slickest color scheme around. This style for the [Colloquy](http://colloquy.info/) IRC client includes both the light and dark variants, as well as some handy tricks like image embedding and optional backdrop images to distinguish public from private rooms.
